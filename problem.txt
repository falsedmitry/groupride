Problem: there is no centralized platform for organizing group cycling rides.
Solution: create an application that would allow users to create, join, and view rides, etc.

Problems:
1. Strava's functionality is absent or poorly implemented/not popular/users don't know about it
2. It's difficult to keep track of the status of the ride:
    Is it still happening if the weather is bad?
    When do rides start in the spring?
    How many people are coming to the ride?
    Who's leading the ride? Who's responsible for structure, directions, duration, intensity (pace)?
    Who is the ride's target demographic? How intense is the ride? Is it drop or no-drop? what is the average speed? Is the ride split into subgroups (such as based on speed)?
    What is the route of the ride? Where is the meeting spot? Are there coffee stops? If so, where?
3. There are too many social media platforms to ensure that all ride participants have access to this information.

Solutions:
1. This app's sole objective (for now) will be to focus on organizing group rides.
2. Every ride will include the above information, or as much of it as possible.
3. The rides will be shareable across many platforms
